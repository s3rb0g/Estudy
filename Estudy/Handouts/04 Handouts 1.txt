Object-Oriented Programming
It is a programming methodology that defines objects whose behaviors and interactions accomplish a given task.

Object
•	An object has characteristics or attributes.
•	The values of an object’s attributes give the object a state.
•	The actions that an object can take are called behaviors. Each behavior is defined by a piece of Java code called a method.
