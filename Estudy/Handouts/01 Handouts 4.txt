Computer Programming   01 Handouts 4

Pseudocode 
	– is a method of describing computer algorithms using a combination of natural language and programming language. It is a technique to show the programming steps.

The following are some rules that are frequently followed when writing pseudocode:
•	Symbols are used for the following common operations:
	•	Arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)
	•	Assignment (=)
	•	Comparison (=, ?, <, >, =, =)
	•	Logical (and, or)
•	Certain keywords can be used as a command, such as PRINT, WRITE, READ, SET, GO TO, etc.
•	Indentation is used to indicate branches and loops of instructions.


Example:
Using the example problem in algorithm.

The pseudocode to find and display the volume of the rectangle is:

READ length 		READ width 
READ height 		SET volume  to  0
PRINT volume		COMPUTE volume  as  length  *  width  *  height
