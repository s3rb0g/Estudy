Human-Computer Interaction   01 Handouts 4

Reduce Memory Load
Humans are more efficient in performing tasks that require light memory load, either for long term or
short term memory. Keeping the user’s short term memory load light is important in relation to the
interface’s role as a quick and easy guide to complete a task. The capacity of human’s short term
memory is about five (5) to nine (9) specific information with respect to the completion of a task.
Light memory load also leads to less erroneous behavior.

Examples:
•	Keeping the number of menu items or tabs to a lesser quantity than what is required for a
human’s short term memory to maintain good user awareness of the ongoing task
•	Windows and Mac provide users with keyboard shortcuts for copy and pasting and for users
to navigate and operate more quickly and effortlessly.

Strive for Consistency
A way to relieve long term memory load of a user is to strive for consistency. This applies to both
interaction model and interface implementation. A user has a higher tendency to be confused and
exhibit inaccurate and inappropriate responses if the same subtask is involved at a different time and
for a different interaction step or interface methods. Aside from being able to remember what to do,
consistency and familiarity lead to higher satisfaction and preference while using the system.

Examples:
•	A consistent look of the interface within a gaming application
•	A consistent interface between Microsoft PowerPoint and Microsoft Word
