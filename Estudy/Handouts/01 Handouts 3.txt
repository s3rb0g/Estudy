Computer Programming   01 Handouts 3

Algorithm	
An algorithm must be expressed completely in a natural language that anyone can follow, such as directions can be written in English language. The computer programmer lists down all the steps required to resolve a problem before writing the actual code.

Example:
Design an algorithm that find and display the volume of a rectangle. It is required to know the rectangle’s length, width, and height, and the formula to know the rectangle’s volume. The formula is: volume = length × width × height.

The algorithm to find and display the volume of the rectangle is:
1.	Get the length of the rectangle.
2.	Get the width of the rectangle.
3.	Get the height of the rectangle.
4.	Find the volume using the formula: volume = length × width × height.
5.	Display the computed volume.

There are two (2) common used tools in representing algorithm:
•	Pseudocode
•	Flowchart.
