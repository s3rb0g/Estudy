•	An abstract data type (ADT) is a logical description of how data is viewed as well as the operations that are allowed without regard to how they will be implemented.

•	Benefits of using ADT:
	o	Code is easier to understand.
	o	Implementations of ADTs can be changed without requiring changes to the program that uses the ADTs.
	o	ADTs can be used in future programs.

•	Two (2) parts of ADT:
	o	Public or external – the data and the operations
	o	Private or internal – the representation and the implementation
