Programming Cycle
	
Algorithm – It is a problem-solving technique used in solving programming problems. It is a step-by-step problem-solving process in which a solution is arrived at in a finite amount of time.

The problem-solving process in the programming environment involves the following steps:
1.	Problem Analysis: Analyze the problem and outline the problem and its solution requirements.
2.	Algorithm Design: Design an algorithm to solve the problem.
3.	Coding: implement the algorithm in a programming language.
4.	Execution: Verify that the algorithm.

To develop a program that solve a problem, start first by analyzing the problem, then outlining the problem and the
options for a solution. Then design the algorithm, write the program instructions, and enter the program into a
computer system.
