Inheritance
•	One way of organizing classes is through inheritance.
•	Inheritance allows objects of a class to take on the properties of objects from another class.
•	Inheritance is used to avoid the repetition of programming instructions for each class.
•	To apply inheritance between classes, the extends keyword is used.
