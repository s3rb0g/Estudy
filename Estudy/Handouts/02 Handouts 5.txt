Data Structures and Algorithms   01 Handouts 5

•	Elements of an algorithm:
	o	Sequential operations
	o	Actions based on the state of a data structure
	o	Iteration – repeating an action multiple times
	o	Recursion – occurs when a function calls itself once or multiple times to solve a problem

•	Algorithm design paradigms:
	o	Divide and Conquer: A problem is broken into smaller subproblems.
	o	Greedy Algorithms: The optimal approach is always chosen in solving a problem.
	o	Dynamic Programming: Similar to Divide and Conquer except that the results of the subproblems are reused for overlapping subproblems.
