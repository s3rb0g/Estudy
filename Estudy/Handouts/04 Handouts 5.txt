Package
•	A package is a collection of related classes and interfaces that have been grouped together into a folder.
•	The name of the folder is the name of the package.
•	The classes in the package are each placed in a separated file and the file name begins with the name of the class.
•	You can use all the classes that are in a package within any program or class definition by placing an import statement.
•	The class does not need to be in the same folder with the classes in the package. The syntax is: import  package_name.class_name_or_asterisk;

Examples are:
import  java.util.Scanner; 
import  java.util.*;
